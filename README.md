Flight Fare Price Prediction Project
Overview:
This project aims to predict flight fare prices based on several input features, such as airline, source, destination, total stops, and duration and date. The project utilizes machine learning techniques such as preprocessing, transformation and random forest regressor to create a predictive model that can estimate flight fares accurately.

Project Workflow:
Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:

Data is ingested using functions in data_ingestion.py.
Data preprocessing and feature engineering are performed in data_transformation.py.
Model Training:

Machine learning models are trained using the data in model_training.py.
You can customize the models and hyperparameters as needed.
Prediction Pipeline:

The prediction_pipeline.py script handles fare predictions based on user input.
Notebook:

The notebook.ipynb contains an interactive Jupyter Notebook that provides insights into the project.
Technologies used:
Python, AWS Ec2 instance.
Libraries used : Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Seaborn, etc.
IDE: VS-code
